    	<p>In the world of startups, passion is considered as the most important quality of founders. I wondered for long time, why passion is so important? Why can’t someone be just good at what they do and figure out the rest? I thought the most important thing was to earn money. Coming from India where most of the business is software services, I saw making money is essentially putting more people on the project. Where does passion come in into this situation? Can you really be passionate about increasing the team size? Hire more people? Without understanding what their roles and functions are? That did not make much sense to me. So I dug deep, If companies in India are founded by the sole purpose of making money, why on earth someone would care if you are passionate about it or not? After coming to Silicon Valley I noticed many people talking their jaws off about passion. Any random act of writing code is coupled with passion, even if a programmer writes a program that adds two integers and nothing else, he must have done it passion. Now this situation was even more mysterious and confusing for me.</p>
<p>I could not see the any reasoning in putting passion first for literaly everything. I thought of it as another Silicon Valley idiosyncrasy. Afterwards, I got the opportunity to meet folks who are doing startups on a regular basis. Without a doubt, these guys were extremely passionate about their products. Everyone of them was so convinced that their product is going to change the world, they forgot the simple fact that 90% of companies in silicon valley fail. Now things got even more interesting at this point. Everyone is passionate, everyone loves their product, then why people can’t build great companies? If everyone loves their product so much and everyone here is passionate about their product, why can’t everyone succeed? Isn’t passion the most important thing? I tried to understand this reasoning for a while. One answer that might be probable is, if the company failed, founders were not passionate enough. This sounds like pure bullshit to me, I feel passion is binary, either you are passionate about something or you are not. End of story.</p>
<p>Bewildered with this situation, I started thinking that there must be some parameter I am missing. Continuing my search on how to build great companies, I came across the concept of lean startup. The principles on which lean startup focus on reflect one simple fact - Practicality. This struck me as the most important aspect in day to day happenings in life. Pragmatism is probably the most desired skill, one has to be practical in his personal and professional life. Similarly, in startups it is important to focus on what is right more than on what you’re passionate about, and practicality is a tool to get there. It is extremely common to be passionate about the wrong idea, and lean startup methodologies teach us how to practically determine vital components of starting a company and shaping ideas. However, pragmatism alone is not sufficient. Pragmatism fails to be the fuel that will drive founder’s vision. It is extremely hard to start and build a company from idea. And passion is the thing that will keep you going. Coupled with passion, pragmatism can make a huge impact.</p>

    	<p>Change is the inevitable part of life. No matter what you do, situations around you are destined to change. Change can be perceived as good or bad depending upon the situation. I love this quote, it simply outlines how short-lived your plans could be, eventually resulting in change of situations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Environment eats your plans for breakfast</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you realize that change is inevitable, you should start looking for ways to best adapt to it. In my personal experience, I follow these guidelines while dealing with change.</p>
<p><strong>Change is neutral, no hard feelings</strong><br>Attaching sentiment to a change will take away the evaluation part of the process. I personally believe categorizing change is okay, but letting it affect your behavior is bad. </p>
<p><strong>Change is inevitable, plan for it</strong><br>If you think hard and boil down your plans, they will always come down to two alternatives; desirable and not desirable. Change might impose a switch of tracks. So be prepared for it.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the next thing, what had to happen, has happened.</strong><br>Dwelling too much on the past often distorts the ability to think straight. An individual has to be practical while perceiving changes in life. Life is only gonna go forward, so better focus on it.</p>
<p>This set of guidelines is bound to evolve with time. If there are any other factors you can imagine, suggestions are most welcome :)</p>

    	<p>Humans are competitive creatures, we always like to move forward in life. Comparing self progress with others is one way to keep the competitive spirit alive, other is to compare self progress. The comparison of self progress usually is with respect to time and position. Over the years, I observed that each year I think I slightly improved myself as compared to last year. This happens almost always, if I do forward interpolation of this thought; I realize that even though I am better than last year, I am stil preparing myself for the next one. In other words, I am better than last year but probably not as much I would be the year next.</p>
<p>Other observation I made is everyone has role models, and these role models also have their role models. This chain keeps on going, it may or may not be circular, but chain keeps on going. Simply put, at each point in time, almost every determined person has a place where he wants to be and where he currently is with respect to time. Considering the betterment of a being as upward progress, we can imagine the entire human community split in herds and standing on mountain slope. The herds above your position are where you want move eventually and herds below you is where you have been.</p>

    	<p>Very often I see people with some arbitrary conceptions. May it be the language war, or adaption to a new technology. It does make me wonder why people behave this way. I have been trying to figure this out for quite some time now, and, thus far, I have been able to make some observations based on the interactions I have had.</p>
<h1 id="The_farmville_theory">The farmville theory</h1>
<p>There was a time when people were crazy about farmville, my facebook inbox was literally filled with farmville requests. It was so bad that I had to eventually block all the notifications from that application. However, this incident sparked an interest on why people are so crazy about farmville. One theory is, farmville could be sending notification without user’s knowledge. Other theory and the more interesting one, is people want to show off their progress in farmville to their friends.</p>
<p>Dissecting this situation led me to two conclusions. First, people feel just because they spend time in some activity, it must be important. As a consequence, when someone puts money in farmville (an arbitrary in-app purchase), the feeling of importance boosts up. Second, self satisfaction is not enough. As humans are community creatures, they need appreciation from peers.</p>
<h1 id="False_pattern_recognition">False pattern recognition</h1>
<p>This one turns out to be one of the classic mistakes people make. Our brains are wired up to make sense out of incomplete and partial data. Pattern recognition is a two way sword, it is the prime reason why humans are at top in foodchain, but false pattern recognition always takes us to a de-tour from facts and real world truth.</p>
<p>This ultimately leads to flawed reasoning. This situation could be related to certain situations in technical world, such as yo! raising a funding of $1M. Nothing personal in this case, but it is funny when folks come up with arbitrary reasons to support their work.</p>
<p>I am a big of the awesome series cosmos. I would like to quote three rules it puts forth in the very first episode.</p>
<ol>
<li>Test ideas by experiment, take the ones that pass, reject the ones that don’t</li>
<li>Take the evidence wherever it leads, and</li>
<li>Question everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel reasoning should be based on tangible evidence. By following above rules, there is a high chance you might end with good reasoning!</p>

    	<p>Recently I shifted my blog from blogger to octopress. In this post I’ll try and cover the reasons for this shift, and the process followed.</p>
<h3 id="Blogger_world">Blogger world</h3>
<p>It is ridiculously easy to set up your blog with blogger. Just a few clicks and your blog is up and running. Blogger also allows you to set up a custom domain without much hastle. And ofcourse with google backing it up, blogger has awesome support for SEO and analytics through google analytics.</p>
<h3 id="Running_into_problems_with_blogger">Running into problems with blogger</h3>
<p>Blogger is simple and fun to get started with, but whenever you want do something out of the line, like embed a piece of code in your blog, it becomes insanely difficult. Many of the folks who write blogs started from blogger and then moved on to more sophisticated platforms such as wordpress. For me, blogger was working fine but there were some really annoying issues. These are the primary ones:</p>
<ol>
<li>No markdown support</li>
<li>Getting code in your blog could be ugly</li>
<li>WYSIWG editor is a big fat lie</li>
<li>Very limited templates - I had to write CSS for almost everything!</li>
<li>Doesn’t have an hacker workflow - sublime, git, markdown, cli</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Search">Search</h3>
<p>Once I was fed up with blogger, I started searching for the next blogging platform. Wordpress was the first choice. With the wide variety of plugins and themes wordpress is really tempting, I even found a plugin for writing blogs in markdown with wordpress. Then I downloaded basic installtion of wordpress, and got it running with local wamp. Now the next big question was of deployment. I could setup an account on wordpress.com, but thats not something I wanted. Dependency on mysql for a blogging platform seemed far-fetched to me. Also, I ran into various issues while deploying wordpress to <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank" rel="external">heroku</a>: heroku supports only PostgreSQL. It’s a bit tricky to get wordpress up and running. I also tried <a href="http://docpad.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">DocPad</a>, <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">ghost</a> and <a href="http://zespia.tw/hexo/" target="_blank" rel="external">hexo</a>. But couldn’t really relate to any of them.</p>
<h3 id="Octopress">Octopress</h3>
<p>While working on github pages for one my open source projects, I wondered how github creates these pages from markdown ? I immediately started looking if they have put it open source. I realized github pages are powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">jekyll</a>. jekyll is nice, but you need a layer of abstraction on top of this to be productive. Then after a bit of googling, I stubled upon octopress. Which runs on jekyll and is very easy to use. More importantly, it supports the workflow I was looking for!</p>
<h3 id="Getting_started_with_octopress">Getting started with octopress</h3>
<p>Octopress requires ruby for compiling your site into static HTML pages. I’m not ruby wizard, words like rake, nokogiri give me an headache. Octopress install <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/" target="_blank" rel="external">page</a> is fairly simple, and easy to understand. One should follow all those instructions piously. I’m serious, don’t miss out a single one, else you’ll be doomed with callstacks of ruby! </p>
<p><strong>Gotcha:</strong> I installed ruby 2.0 x64 edition, on the site it says <strong>1.9.3 or greater</strong>. But octopress just blew up when I tried compiling it on ruby 2.0. So a word of advice, <strong>stick with 1.9.3</strong>, don’t try to get fancy if you don’t know ruby.</p>
<h3 id="Porting_old_blogs_to_octopress">Porting old blogs to octopress</h3>
<p>First, you need to export the blogger information, it should give you an xml file. You should find this option in settings tab on the left side. <a href="https://gist.github.com/juniorz/1564581" target="_blank" rel="external">this</a> gist has the code for converting that ugly xml to octopress friendly blog files.</p>
<p><strong>Gotcha:</strong> This gist requires a ruby gem nokogiri (ruby-gems is the package manager for ruby). To install nokogiri you have to run</p>
<figure class="highlight rb"><pre><div class="line">gem install nokogiri</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">//If this doesn't work in your case try</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">rb gem install nokogiri --pre</div></pre></figure>

<p>I’m not sure what it does, but this worked for me!</p>
<h3 id="Deploying_to_github_pages_and_adding_a_custom_domain">Deploying to github pages and adding a custom domain</h3>
<p>One of sweetest feature of octopress is no run time dependency. End output is just plain HTML, CSS, JS and could be deployed on any static file server. Github pages provide an excellent option, I already had a github account so I followed steps from <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/" target="_blank" rel="external">this</a> link.</p>
<p><strong>Gotcha:</strong> Deploying to <code>username.github.io</code> will mess up your project pages. Deploy to gh-pages branch of a seperate repo in case you are using github pages.</p>
<p>Setting up a custom domain was easy once I figured out what to do. I deployed octopress to a seperate repository. So I had to add a CNAME file with my domain name in it, e.g</p>
<figure class="highlight rb"><figcaption><span>CNAME </span></figcaption><pre><div class="line">chinmaymk.com</div></pre></figure>

<p>Then I had to edit the DNS entry for <code>@</code> to <code>204.232.175.78</code> from my godaddy account. Note: It could take upto 48 hours to activate, in my case it kicked off within a couple of hours.</p>
<h3 id="Adding_disquss_comments">Adding disquss comments</h3>
<p>Octopress does not have native support for comments, to get comments in your blog you have to setup an account with <a href="http://disqus.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">disquss</a>. It will ask you a couple of questions such as what’s your domain name and site name etc. Finish those and in <code>_config.yml</code> add your <code>disquss_short_name</code>. Run <code>rake generate</code> and disquss comments should enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Gotcha:</strong> There’s a flag in every post named <code>comments:</code> you have to set it to true.</p>
<p>And that was it! after a whole night dedicated to get this working, I finally had octopress up and running.</p>
