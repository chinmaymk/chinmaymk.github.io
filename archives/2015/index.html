    	<p>Humans are creatures of habit. Human brain learns certain pattern over time and after a while they become reflexes. User experience of mobile apps is limited by tiny screen size, touch controls, and sensors. Thus, establishing a deterministic familiar pattern is crucial for user experience.</p>
<p>I regularly use my iPhone and nexus tablet for reading, social networking, emails, and checking updates on the go. This mix of android and iOS gives me diverse yet somewhat unified experience for the apps I use. Even though most of my actions are mechanical by now, there are still some nuances I would like to address.</p>
<h1 id="Platform_defined_gestures">Platform defined gestures</h1>
<p>iOS provides left-swipe and right-swipe  gestures for list views. All native apps as well many popular apps have implemented those. However, dropbox does not use them for their iOS mobile app. Swipe to right on file list does not provide any options for moving/deleting the file. This is a pattern based affordance which plays an important role in defining user experience  Remedy would be to use gestures defined by operating system to make user experience consistent.</p>
<h1 id="Meaningful_icons">Meaningful icons</h1>
<p>On iOS, buttons style was changed to their textual representation for better clarity. I personally favor this arrangement over icons that make little sense. Over time, some icons have been strongly associated with actions e.g. refresh, stop, back, forward, mail, and user. Adding new icons in mobile apps is harders because mobile apps can not show metadata associated with icon in form of hover box. Thus it is often left to user to unravel the mystery of it. I think this approach is cumbersome and degrades user experience substantially. One example of this is flickr iOS app. Sync icon (indicating all photos have been uploaded) and news feed icon do not convey any meaning over pointers to actions performed by them. Using standard icons or textual buttons would have been better.</p>
<h1 id="Deterministic_behavior">Deterministic behavior</h1>
<p>When app performs an action in response to user input, it must be repeatable. In practice however, it is often false. Mobile apps in current days have great dependency on active data connection. Thus they fail to scale down gracefully in case a data connection is absent. For example, mobile apps crash when train enters the tunnel. The same actions performed by user in presence of data connection cause incorrect behavior when data connection is absent. This is not a user experience. Applications should indicate which actions are disabled temporarily while they wait for internet connectivity. On the good side, many applications such as gmail and flickr have started including this functionality. Going forward, it would be great to see graceful degrades in more mobile apps.</p>

    	<p>Web application frameworks are awesome. They take care of repeatitive tasks so developers don’t have to. I have worked and played with many web frameworks including <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc" target="_blank" rel="external">ASP.Net mvc</a>, <a href="https://www.playframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">play</a>, <a href="expressjs.com">express</a>, <a href="sailsjs.org">sails</a>, <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/#quick-start" target="_blank" rel="external">spring</a>, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">django</a>, <a href="http://martini.codegangsta.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">martini</a> and so on. Even though these frameworks vary in API offerings and environments, they are built on same fundamentals. </p>
<p>I think it is easy to pick up any web framework once underlying concepts are understood. From bird’s eye view, framework is just a bunch of code that developers could reuse. Consequently, it becomes easy to identify and learn structure of this code. In this post, I will try to sum up a mindset for learning any framework. Before jumping into details, let me establish ground zero.</p>
<p><strong>No magic</strong><br>There is absolutely no magic in frameworks. Someone somewhere has written that code so you don’t have to. If anything in the framework seems magical, one can simply open the source code and check the implementation (well, as most of the frameworks are open source anyway).</p>
<p><strong>HTTP HTTP HTTP</strong><br>For web application frameworks, everything starts and ends with HTTP. It is crucial to understand request-response cycle. All the communication with browser is done by passing packets of HTTP.</p>
<h2 id="Good_old_request-response_cycle">Good old request-response cycle</h2>
<p>Now let’s try to disect an entire request-response cycle and understand it conceptually. </p>
<p><strong>Where’s the entry point?</strong><br>As everything is communicated HTTP, there must be a point point where HTTP packet is read and sent to appropriate function to process. Most of the frameworks have routes definition as entry point where developers can interact with request. But even before that, the framework needs to parse and construct a request object from HTTP packet. Frameworks usually have a route file or annotations to specify handlers.</p>
<p><strong>But how do I know this request is valid?</strong><br>Next, the request is usually authenticated. That means somewhere in the codebase there should be a mapping of session IDs and session data. It could be in memeory or in external data store such as mongo or redis. This layer is nothing but middleware (anything that runs between route and controller).</p>
<p><strong>Okay… what next?</strong><br>This is where primary logic of app starts executing. This layer is controllers. Controllers usually talk with some data interface to combine and manipulate data from different sources.</p>
<p><strong>Where’s my data coming from?</strong><br>Most of the frameworks provide a way to interact with databases. Models are representative of data tables or collections. Some frameworks also provide associations while some emphasize on BYORM (bring your own ORM). Another way of populating data is from cache. Since database calls are expensive, web developers try to minimize cost by storing as much data as possible in caches.</p>
<p><strong>We need to respond something, right?</strong><br>After the data has been gathered, we need to send something to client. This could be a browser or a third party application. This is usually done in last couple of lines of code in controller logic. The data is transformed to JSON or HTML based on the requirement. Most of the frameworks provide one or more ways of creating HTML and encoding data in JSON. After encoding, frameworks take care of putting the data in proper HTTP packets and sending it back to clients.</p>
<p>And that’s it! In retrospect, these points have helped me pick up many frameworks quite quickly. I hope they work for you as well!</p>

    	<p>Six months have passed since I first stepped foot in valley. Yes, its called the valley not Silicon Valley and San Fransisco is called the city. Last six months have been absolutely wonderful. I got the opportunity to learn about startup culture in the valley and be a part of this dynamic ecosystem. Along the way, I noticed some unique things. In this post, I will try and provide a gist of it.</p>
<p><strong>Weather is awesome</strong><br>No post about valley is complete without mentioning how beautiful the weather is. There is ample sunlight, enough cold, and soothing breezes all around year. All types of different destinations are in driving distance from here; from snowy mountains to sea to desert.</p>
<p><strong>Failure is a credential</strong><br>Failures are seen differently here. It is quite normal to have three or four failed attempts before building a product that succeeds. In fact, it is almost a ritual to write a detailed blog post about failed products.</p>
<p><strong>Everybody writes code</strong><br>Basic programming skills are in abudance. Even marketing people know programming 101. I remember my Uber driver asking me questions about interfaces in Java, that just blew me away.</p>
<p><strong>Everybody is killing it, all the time</strong><br>In every coffee shop, there are always intense discussions going on about how a certain industry is gonna be disrupted. Its not unusual to see few geeks trying to pitch their idea to investors or to see android study groups gathered around dinner table.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting legends is normal</strong><br>Silicon Valley isn’t short of talent. It is likely to meet to great minds in computer industry. Over the last six months, I met Don Knuth, Peter Norvig, Vint Cerf, Andrew Ng. It definitely is an awesome experience interacting with legends.</p>

    	<p>Looking back at my journey so far, here are few things that would have made my life easier. </p>
<p><strong>It is not easy</strong><br>You’re gonna spend a lot of time searching through resources. Just running an algorithm from caret library isn’t enough. You have to understand the maths behind it and it takes a lot of careful reading and mental efforts. Any resource that tells you “you don’t need to learn maths” is probably not worth the efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning is just one part of data science</strong><br>Data science as a whole is much bigger game. Machine learning is just one bit of it. Even though not officially defined, it involves data pre-processing/cleansing, feature engineering, modeling, model training, model validation, presentation of results as building blocks. It is critical to move beyond pre defined techniques and develope an intuition for all factos in data science.</p>
<p><strong>Mostly, you will be occupied with preparing data sets</strong><br>When you’re doing machine learning, majority of time will be spend in preparing data: extracting data from multiple sources, cleaning datasets, aligning different datasets, mapping attributes to different dimensions etc.</p>
<p><strong>Visualizations are important</strong><br>Running all the algorithms is cool. But it is not of much use if it cannot be presented effectively to people who are not from machine learning background, executives and product managers are probably not gonna spend time looking how your R console looks. Creating visualizations considering both technical and non technical audience is crucial in machine learning.</p>
<p><strong>There are libraries for EVERYTHING, you just need to find them</strong><br>Most of the popular algorithms are already implemented in R and python. This serves great as a point of reference for performance. Also, it helps a lot understanding configuration options of each algorithm and see how it affects your model. Sure, you can code up an algorithm. But do it from learning’s perspective or only if required.</p>
<p><strong>Most of the valuable material is in books and papers</strong><br>Most of the online resources (including this post) will never give you the “whole deal”. They usually work only if you follow exactly what they say. But they don’t give much intuition on how to extend it beyond the example presented in the article. Eventually you will start reading books to get a better understanding.</p>
<p>Following the path of machine learning is a big commitment in terms of time and efforts. Be prepared for it.</p>
