    	<p>Change is the inevitable part of life. No matter what you do, situations around you are destined to change. Change can be perceived as good or bad depending upon the situation. I love this quote, it simply outlines how short-lived your plans could be, eventually resulting in change of situations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Environment eats your plans for breakfast</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you realize that change is inevitable, you should start looking for ways to best adapt to it. In my personal experience, I follow these guidelines while dealing with change.</p>
<p><strong>Change is neutral, no hard feelings</strong><br>Attaching sentiment to a change will take away the evaluation part of the process. I personally believe categorizing change is okay, but letting it affect your behavior is bad. </p>
<p><strong>Change is inevitable, plan for it</strong><br>If you think hard and boil down your plans, they will always come down to two alternatives; desirable and not desirable. Change might impose a switch of tracks. So be prepared for it.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the next thing, what had to happen, has happened.</strong><br>Dwelling too much on the past often distorts the ability to think straight. An individual has to be practical while perceiving changes in life. Life is only gonna go forward, so better focus on it.</p>
<p>This set of guidelines is bound to evolve with time. If there are any other factors you can imagine, suggestions are most welcome :)</p>

    	<p>Humans are competitive creatures, we always like to move forward in life. Comparing self progress with others is one way to keep the competitive spirit alive, other is to compare self progress. The comparison of self progress usually is with respect to time and position. Over the years, I observed that each year I think I slightly improved myself as compared to last year. This happens almost always, if I do forward interpolation of this thought; I realize that even though I am better than last year, I am stil preparing myself for the next one. In other words, I am better than last year but probably not as much I would be the year next.</p>
<p>Other observation I made is everyone has role models, and these role models also have their role models. This chain keeps on going, it may or may not be circular, but chain keeps on going. Simply put, at each point in time, almost every determined person has a place where he wants to be and where he currently is with respect to time. Considering the betterment of a being as upward progress, we can imagine the entire human community split in herds and standing on mountain slope. The herds above your position are where you want move eventually and herds below you is where you have been.</p>

    	<p>Very often I see people with some arbitrary conceptions. May it be the language war, or adaption to a new technology. It does make me wonder why people behave this way. I have been trying to figure this out for quite some time now, and, thus far, I have been able to make some observations based on the interactions I have had.</p>
<h1 id="The_farmville_theory">The farmville theory</h1>
<p>There was a time when people were crazy about farmville, my facebook inbox was literally filled with farmville requests. It was so bad that I had to eventually block all the notifications from that application. However, this incident sparked an interest on why people are so crazy about farmville. One theory is, farmville could be sending notification without user’s knowledge. Other theory and the more interesting one, is people want to show off their progress in farmville to their friends.</p>
<p>Dissecting this situation led me to two conclusions. First, people feel just because they spend time in some activity, it must be important. As a consequence, when someone puts money in farmville (an arbitrary in-app purchase), the feeling of importance boosts up. Second, self satisfaction is not enough. As humans are community creatures, they need appreciation from peers.</p>
<h1 id="False_pattern_recognition">False pattern recognition</h1>
<p>This one turns out to be one of the classic mistakes people make. Our brains are wired up to make sense out of incomplete and partial data. Pattern recognition is a two way sword, it is the prime reason why humans are at top in foodchain, but false pattern recognition always takes us to a de-tour from facts and real world truth.</p>
<p>This ultimately leads to flawed reasoning. This situation could be related to certain situations in technical world, such as yo! raising a funding of $1M. Nothing personal in this case, but it is funny when folks come up with arbitrary reasons to support their work.</p>
<p>I am a big of the awesome series cosmos. I would like to quote three rules it puts forth in the very first episode.</p>
<ol>
<li>Test ideas by experiment, take the ones that pass, reject the ones that don’t</li>
<li>Take the evidence wherever it leads, and</li>
<li>Question everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel reasoning should be based on tangible evidence. By following above rules, there is a high chance you might end with good reasoning!</p>
